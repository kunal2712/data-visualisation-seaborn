Guide to data visualisation using seaborn library by plotting various types of data in different forms of graphs.

* Seaborn is a Python library for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is built on top of Matplotlib, but provides a high-level interface for drawing common statistical plots. Seaborn includes a variety of plot types, including:

1.  Relational plots: These plots show the relationship between two or more variables. For example, a scatter plot shows the relationship between two continuous variables, while a point plot shows the relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable.

2. Distribution plots: These plots show the distribution of a single variable. For example, a histogram shows the distribution of a continuous variable, while a box plot shows the distribution of a categorical variable.

3. Categorical plots: These plots show the relationship between a categorical variable and another variable. For example, a count plot shows the number of observations in each category of a categorical variable, while a violin plot shows the distribution of a continuous variable within each category of a categorical variable.

* This tutorial will show you how to create these and other types of plots using Seaborn. It will also cover some of the customization options available in Seaborn, so that you can create plots that are tailored to your specific needs.
